# Digital Business Card / React Vite Example Test Project

## A digital business card built referencing Scrimba's React course written in React using Vite to scaffold.

This project is an example that was built along with a course on Scrimba showing how to create React applications using Vite. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

* Scaffold a React project using Vite
* Creating and organizing modular components within the project's repository
* Assemble a functional web application out of separate components

My key takeaway from completing this project was the benefits of using the BEM methodology when giving classNames to elements. It kept my naming more consistent and fitting because each name would be relative to the parent component rather than its relation to the app as a whole which could be more abstract and misleading as a result. I intend to continue using BEM in future projects when giving names to classes as it is an easy way to add more clarity and structure to my code.
